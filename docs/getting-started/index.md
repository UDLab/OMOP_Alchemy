# Getting Started

This section introduces the core ideas behind OMOP Alchemy and how to begin using it in
your own projects.

OMOP Alchemy is designed to be safe to import anywhere and flexible enough to integrate
with existing pipelines, research workflows, and analysis environments. These pages
cover installation, and a minimal quickstart to orient you.
