# OMOP Alchemy

OMOP Alchemy provides a **canonical, typed, SQLAlchemy-first** representation of the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).

It is designed for **research-ready analytics, validation, and exploration**.

## Where OMOP Alchemy fits

OMOP Alchemy sits between raw OMOP databases and exploratory analytics, validation, and research tooling

It provides:

- stable ORM models
- explicit relationships
- safe, inspectable abstractions

without imposing workflow assumptions.

## Example

```python

concept = session.get(ConceptView, 320128)
concept.domain.domain_id
concept.vocabulary.vocabulary_id
concept.is_standard
```

### Status

OMOP Alchemy is currently beta. The core model surface is stabilising; feedback is welcome.
