    Declarative specification for constructing a vocabulary lookup index.

    A LookupSpec defines *what* concepts should be included in a lookup and
    *which textual representations* should be indexed for resolution.

    The spec is consumed by a OMOPConceptSource, which materialises a LookupIndex
    by querying an OMOP vocabulary source and extracting the requested fields.

    This separation allows lookup semantics (domain, vocabulary, hierarchy,
    standardness, synonyms, normalisation) to be expressed explicitly and
    versioned independently of runtime resolution logic.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name:
        Stable identifier for this lookup specification. 
    unknown:
        Concept ID to return for unmatched terms. Set to None to preserve
        nulls, or to a sentinel concept ID to force closed-world behaviour.
    domain_id:
        Optional OMOP domain filter 
    concept_class_id:
        Optional list of OMOP concept_class_id values to restrict the lookup
    vocabulary_id:
        Optional list of OMOP vocabulary_id values to restrict the lookup
    standard_only:
        If True, restricts the lookup to standard concepts only.
    code_filter:
        Optional substring filter applied to concept_code (ILIKE-based).
        Useful for coarse scoping (e.g. AJCC-only codes).
    parents:
        Optional list of ancestor concept IDs from which to expand the lookup
        via the Concept_Ancestor table.
    include_non_standard_descendants:
        If True, includes non-standard concepts when expanding from parents.
        Has no effect if parents is None.
    include_synonyms:
        If True, include Concept_Synonym entries in the lookup keys.
    normalizer:
        Function applied to all indexed strings at build time. This should
        match (or be compatible with) the normalisation used at resolution
        time by ConceptResolver.
    include:
        Tuple of ConceptRow attribute names to index as keys (e.g.
        ("concept_name", "concept_code")). This controls which textual fields
        become resolvable inputs.

    Notes
    -----
    - LookupSpec encodes *semantic intent*; LookupIndex encodes *runtime state*.
    - Specs are designed to be stable, inspectable configuration objects that
      can be versioned and reviewed as part of phenotype or ETL definitions.
    - Normalisation and correction policies are intentionally split between
      build-time (this spec) and runtime (ConceptResolver) to make lookup
      behaviour explicit and testable.

class ConceptResolver:

    """
    Runtime resolver for mapping free-text terms to OMOP concept IDs.

    A ConceptResolver wraps a pre-built LookupIndex and applies runtime
    normalisation and optional correction passes to resolve arbitrary
    input strings to concept IDs. It is intentionally lightweight and
    stateless: all semantic scope and vocabulary constraints are encoded
    upstream in the LookupSpec and LookupIndex.

    Resolution proceeds in ordered stages:
    1. Apply the primary normaliser to the input term and attempt a direct lookup.
    2. If no hit is found, apply each correction function in turn, re-normalise,
       and retry the lookup.
    3. If no match is found, return the configured ``unknown`` concept ID.

    This design allows simple, explicit handling of common data quality issues
    (e.g. formatting differences, legacy codes, mild normalisation errors)
    without introducing fuzzy matching, probabilistic scoring, or hidden
    inference logic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index:
        Pre-built LookupIndex providing the normalised key → concept_id mapping.
    normalizer:
        Optional normalisation function applied to input terms at lookup time.
        Defaults to ``normalize_default``. This should be compatible with the
        normaliser used when constructing the LookupIndex.
    corrections:
        Optional ordered list of correction functions applied to the raw input
        term prior to normalisation and lookup. Each correction is tried in
        sequence until a match is found.

    Notes
    -----
    - ConceptResolver performs no database access and no dynamic expansion of
      vocabularies; it operates over the materialised LookupIndex.
    - Resolution is deterministic and transparent: there is no fuzzy matching,
      ranking, or probabilistic inference.
    - Correction functions are applied conservatively and in-order; later
      corrections do not override earlier successful matches.
    - ``lookup_exact`` bypasses correction passes and performs a single
      normalised lookup, which is useful for validation and debugging.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> resolver = ConceptResolver(index)
    >>> resolver.lookup("Stage III")
    123456
    >>> resolver.lookup("stage-3")
    123456
